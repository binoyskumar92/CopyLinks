# CopyLinks
Android app to copylinks from PC to Mobile and viceversa.

Following is comon scenario for all of us.
1. You are watching something on your mobile and you want to ee that in your PC. For eg a youtube video or any link shared by someone. 
2. You are watching or reading something in your PC/aptop and you need th elink/text on your phone.

The first solution that comes to mind is WhatsappforWeb for many if you are a whatsapp user. if you are a chrome user then bookmarks is a good way to go or even a facebook messenger might suffice. All these have their pros n cons. The CopylinkApp solution is a very straghtforward solution to this problem. For this main thing i have taken into consideration is simplicity. The description below outlines how to use the app.

1. Clone the repo and build it using Android studio to create the apk.
2. Install the app(do make sure if installing from unknown sources is enabled if apk is directly installed or shared)
